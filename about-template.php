                    <p>We’re a full commercial cleaning solution that can be tailored to any industry. We are not a franchise. We never will be.</p>
                    <p>We’re owned and operated by Harvey Frame and Wim Baars. Supporting them is a small but perfectly formed team of outstanding account managers, one of whom will be your dedicated 24/7 point of contact throughout the partnership.</p>
                    <p>We vacuumed our first office in Wellington in 2012. Today we equip and co-ordinate pods of New Zealand’s best cleaners to go out and destroy dust and dirt wherever it exists throughout the country.</p>

            <p>The products we use and supply, the bins we provide, and the way we use energy, all help to spread awareness and subtly nudge Kiwis towards using less toxic products and being less wasteful. And the bonus is, that can save you money.</p>
